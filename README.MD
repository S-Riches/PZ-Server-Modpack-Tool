### An API to help people turn steam collections into servers.

This API is for Project Zomboid server owners to be able to turn steam collections into dedicated servers without the manual effort of clicking each individual mod and getting the mod id and the workshop id. However i don't see any reason why this cant be applied to any other steam dedicated game server as it just grabs the collection and the mod ids + workshop ids.
